## Hello world! 👋

I'm Daiana, I have a degree in Food Science and Technology, with 10 years of experience in manufacturing industry. During my career, I've discovered my passion not only in the food manufacturing but also in the world of data science.

I'm eager to connect with other data analysis enthusiasts, learn from their experiences, and contribute to interesting projects.

I’m currently immersed in the process of learning all the essential tools for data analysis, including:

  ⚡Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit.
  
  ⚡SQL for database management and querying.
  
  ⚡Power Bi
  
  ⚡Machine Learning

I'm looking forward to connecting with you all and being part of this vibrant community of data analysts on GitHub!
